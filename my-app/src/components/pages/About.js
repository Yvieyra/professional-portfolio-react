            <p>I am currently a student at the University of Utah, and I am learning fullstack development. I appreciate the problem solving skills I have learned to develop apps,
                programs, and just about anything I want with dedication and continuous learning.

                I am a passionate about learning new ideas, skills, and technology who works well with others in a team setting.
                I have strong communication/emotional intelligence skills. Equally, I work well on my own and have become quite the multi-tasker, I manage my time well.</p>
